    "The 3 stage text adventure game based on the movie Prison Break is an exciting and thrilling experience that immerses players into the world of Michael Scofield and his mission to break out of prison and clear his brother's name. In stage 1, players take on the role of Michael and must gather information and resources to help him plan his escape. The player must explore the prison and interact with other inmates to gather clues and items that will aid in the escape plan. Along the way, players will encounter challenges and obstacles that they must overcome to progress. In stage 2, the player puts the escape plan into action, and must navigate through the prison, avoid detection and overcome obstacles to reach the outside. This stage requires the player to use stealth, intelligence and problem-solving skills to escape undetected. The player must also make quick and strategic decisions to avoid getting caught. In stage 3, Michael is on the run from the authorities and must use his cunning and intelligence to evade capture and clear his brother's name. In this stage, the player must solve puzzles and make decisions that will determine Michael's fate. They will encounter different scenarios and challenges that will test their ability to think critically and make decisions on the fly. The game is a combination of problem solving, puzzle-solving and decision-making as the player controls Michael in his quest for freedom. The game is designed to keep the players engaged and on the edge of their seats as they experience the same adrenaline-pumping action and tension of the movie. The game's story is based on the movie and it's a great way to experience the story if you are a fan of the movie. It's also a great game for anyone who likes text adventure and problem-solving games.\n",
